This is Project wheree I have created Multipage react form with Progressbar.

Here after successfull completion of form, it redirects to JsonToSheet named Spreadsheet where clint can see their complete information.

Inorder to start an application you user need to do is to:

1) Clone repository
2) npm i =>to install all libraries and packages once
3) npm start =>inorder to start an application

Future statics to be performed:

1) Making it mobile responses
2) Adding bootstrap class to make css file readable
3) Making it secure by implementing user authentication
4) Design related issues to be fixed.
